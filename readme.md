## Usage

[Demo](https://u-wave.github.io/react-list-lazy-load) - [Demo source code](./example.js)

React List Lazy Load is a higher order component, so you wrap it around a
`<ReactList />` element to :sparkles: magically :sparkles: add lazy loading
hooks.

```js
import ReactList from 'react-list';
import LazyLoading from 'react-list-lazy-load';

const MyList = ({ items, onRequestPage }) => (
  <LazyLoading
    length={items.length}
    items={items}
    onRequestPage={onRequestPage}
  >
    <ReactList
      itemRenderer={(idx, key) => (
        <div key={key}>{items[idx]}</div>
      )}
      type="uniform"
      length={items.length}
    />
  </LazyLoading>
);
```

## API

### `items={Array}`

An array of the items you're showing. This is used to determine when to load a
page. If the user scrolls close to a `null` item in this array, or outside of
array bounds, a new page will be loaded.

I.e., a `null` item is regarded as an unloaded item.

### `length={Number}`

The total amount of items, on all "pages". Defaults to

### `pageSize={Number}`

Amount of items on a page. This is used to determine which page to load.
Defaults to 25 (rather arbitrarily).

### `loadMargin={Number}`

When to start loading the next page. The next page will be loaded when the user
scrolls within `loadMargin` items from an unloaded item. You'll want to change
this depending on the size of your items. If your items are super small, you
should pick a larger `loadMargin`, but if they are rather large, you might be
good with a margin of like 1 or 2 items.

Defaults to 5.

### `onRequestPage={function(page, cb)}`

Callback to load a page. This only tells you to load a new page--you should
merge it into the `items` prop yourself.
